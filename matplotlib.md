## MatPlotLib Visualisation project

**Project description:** Data visualisation project looking at earthquake activity in October & November 2021

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Looking at the data I hypothesised that deep earthquakes aren't necessarily all high magnitude, but that low magnitude deep earthquakes aren't powerful enough to be recorded by current equipment.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
